            <span class="subtitle is-4 q">What is Ethics Bowl?</span>
            <p class="content container"><br>
              Put simply, Ethics Bowl is a competition between two teams on a 
              variety of social, political, religious and environmental dilemmas. 
              Teams will present their stance or comment on the moral permissibility of
              certain acts, often drawing from philosophical considerations and research. 
              Aside from the competitive aspect, Ethics Bowl uses a unique format and has
              a different objective from usual highschool debate. Instead of having a 
              rigid, pre-determined stance for participants, the competition facilitates 
              a structured discussion that underscores the presentation of premises, 
              important points and commentary that challenges those points. Instead of
              disagreeing just for the sake of it, the team that exhibits more precision
              and presents more complex talking points will win, even if their stances are
              similar.

          <div class="column is-3">
            <span class="subtitle is-4 q">Why is Ethics Bowl’s approach more useful than regular debate?</span>
            <p class="content container"><br>
              Whether it’s heated debates or partisan media, divisive politics 
              plagues most issues, and its not always the most 
              productive manner of coming to solutions. While debate is advantageous for 
              strengthening rhetorical skills, Ethics Bowl 
              accomplishes this while also being an effective model for resolving 
              real-world issues. The focal 
              point is to work together to accurately determine the premises and  
              morally salient points relavent to a particular issue. 
              Instead of verbally sparring with cherry picked data, all mindsets are 
              considered and moral delineations justified. We make room for 
              agreement and common ground when possible and try to bring nuance to the 
              discussion.

          <div class="column is-3">
            <span class="subtitle is-4 q">What is the Ethics Bowl format?</span>
            <p class="content container"><br>
              The Regional and National Ethics Bowl rules are subject to change. The most 
              recent format is found on page 4 of the official <a href="https://nhseb.unc.edu/files/2019/09/Rules-Procedures-and-Guidelines-2019-2020.pdf">rulebook</a>. The general 
              structure is that two teams will have time to discuss two different cases 
              within one round. For the first case, one team will have time to confer and 
              present, and the other team will have time to confer and give commentary. 
              The first team will have time to confer and respond. During the discussion 
              of the next case, roles between teams are switched, so both teams will have 
              the same amount of speaking time overall. At the end of a round, judges will 
              score each team based on delivery, rhetoric and other criteria.

            <span class="subtitle is-4 q">What are Ethics Bowl cases? </span>
            <p class="content container"><br>
              Ethics bowl releases a packet of 15-17 cases, which presents a curated 
              selection of hypothetical scenarios and general real world issues. The 
              regional competition occurs at the beginning of each year and packets are 
              released a few months in advance. The national competition is open to 
              qualified teams who won their regional competitions during the spring of 
              each year, and the packet is released 4-5 weeks in advance for participants 
              to study. Examples of these cases can be found in the <a href="https://nhseb.unc.edu/case-archive/">official case archive</a>.

              <p class="content" style="color: black;" id="p">
                Our team not only aims to compete at the regional and national levels each year, 
                but to get more people to reflect on and incorporate ethical considerations 
                in their lives. Whether they have a personal conflict to resolve, whether 
                they are the decision-makers of another club or organization, or whether 
                they are coming to a stance on a national or world issue, ethics, 
                rhetorical skills, and abilities to fairly resolve issues gained through 
                participating in Ethics Forum are always going to be relevant and integral. 
                <br><br>
                We plan on integrating with the rest of the student body at our very own 
                Stuyvesant High School through a digital magazine, Ethical Inquiries (and Where to Find Them), 
                which is open to art and writing submissions from general students 
                regarding ethics topics. 
                <br><br>
                We also have plans to host events with panel discussions annually to get 
                students engaged in ethics, thinking more deeply about controversial issues, 
                and getting more exposure to professional discussions, with the hope that 
                they will model such professionalism in other areas of their lives and 
                careers. <br><br><br>
