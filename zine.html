<!--

    The Ethical Forum is pleased to bring you our online magazine, Ethical Inquiries (and Where to Find Them)! Our Chief Editor, Grace Chen works in lieu with the rest of our publication branch to put out this magazine once a semester. Our focus is to use this platform to report on and comment on current events, environmental, social, and political topics with moral and philosophical considerations. No matter what area of life it is, ethical considerations remain relevant in how we treat other people, how we make decisions that affect ourselves and others and how we balance commitments and othersâ€™ perspectives. 

    This magazine has a team of writers and artists who put out artwork, critical essays, and other creative works in each issue, but also takes one-time submissions from anyone who would like to be featured. In order to facilitate more discourse and interest in ethics and philosophy, there are no submission barriers based on grade or school, and we are always seeking to expand our audience and welcome new contributors.
