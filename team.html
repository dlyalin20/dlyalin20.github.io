                                    I'm Sarah Cheyney, junior at Stuyvesant High School. I've been a member of Ethics 
                                    Bowl since my freshman year and previously held the position of Youth Outreach 
                                    Director, and am now Co-President. I was drawn to Ethics Bowl because of its open, 
                                    non-judgemental space to discuss all forms of thought and gain new perspectives. 
                                    After learning about and discussing numerous forms of thought, ethics changed the
                                    way I view life and our world (I can pretty much guarantee it'll do the same for 
                                    you). It also gave me the tools I needed to verbalise my viewpoint powerfully and 
                                    concisely in all parts of my life, academic and personal. Aside from being a 
                                    philosophy and debate fanatic, I love creative writing and 
                                    studying Spanish -- the language and the culture!

                                    Hey, I‚Äôm Daniel ‚ÄúDexter‚Äù Lyalin, a junior at Stuyvesant and Vice President of the
                                    Ethics Bowl team. I was drawn to Ethics Bowl as a freshmen because it presented a
                                    better alternative to what I perceived was the dogmatic, polarized format provided 
                                    by the debate team; I found Ethics Bowl to be more suited to my tastes, 
                                    prioritizing critical thought and discussion over aggressive and blind 
                                    defensiveness. Ethics Bowl allowed me to reason not just about what is right, 
                                    but also why something right. I‚Äôve found that the skills provided in Ethics Bowl 
                                    have helped me blossom as a moral being, helping me be more conscientious and 
                                    make better decisions. When I‚Äôm not prepping for competitions, you can find me 
                                    volunteering with the Red Cross or programming (the site you‚Äôre on right now was 
                                    made by yours truly!). In my free time, I enjoy playing tennis and watching 
                                    standup-comedy (I‚Äôm a diehard John Mulaney and James Acaster stan).

                            <p class="content">
                                When I joined this club in freshman year, it was a small team focused on 
                                competing at High School Ethics Bowl events, hence the name of the club. 
                                I've always enjoyed employing the art of persuasion in writing, however ask 
                                me to confidently articulate those same points, and I was not able to. 
                                After pushing myself through some difficult--  and embarrassing-- speeches, 
                                thanks to the welcoming environment, I found myself thinking more critically, 
                                and picking up more  skills on smooth, and confident delivery. I came into 
                                this team to improve my rhetoric, but I stayed for the rich discussions we 
                                had every meeting. The more I was forced to justify every simple assumption, 
                                the less black and white everything became. The more I listened and cooperated 
                                in the discussion, the more compassion I saw in others with dissenting 
                                viewpoints. With our current heated political climate, I found it imperative 
                                to preserve the philosophy, nuanced thinking and more importantly, the 
                                spirit of Ethics Bowl. Although the competition requires a small team, I'm 
                                dedicated to expanding it into a large club with other activities to get 
                                more students exposed to ethical studies.

                                especially ethics, so I ended up joining Ethics Bowl in my
                                sophomore year. In my free time, I enjoy playing the piano and drawing 
                                (even though I suck at it üôÉ). I also really enjoy writing basically anything
                                 and I hope to major in psychology in the future.
